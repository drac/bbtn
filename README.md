Usage
=====

Button styles can be applied to anything with the .bbtn class applied. However, typically you'll want to apply these to only <a> and <div> elements for the best rendering.

First of all you should <link> to bbtn.css

<link rel="stylesheet" href="path-to/bbtn.css">

by using only the <a> tag

<a href="#" class="bbtn" role="button">button-text</a>

by using the <a> and <div> tags

<a href="#"><div class="bbtn" role="button">button-text</div></a>
